ADHD ~= Vulnerability to dopamine.  

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter (a chemical in the brain). It creates different effects in different circuits.  

- Smooth movement  
  Deficiency leads to Parkinsons disease.  
- Misolimbic Circuit  
  This governs **pleasure**, **craving** and **behavioral reinforcement**.  
  It convinces other parts of the brain that *something not great* is a good idea.

In people with ADHD, pleasure is really really fun.
