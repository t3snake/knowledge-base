Dopamine can be explained by the **lemon squeeze theory**.  
When waking up in the morning, we have a full lemon or full dopamine stores.  
Then as we do activities, we squeeze out the juice (dopamine). The more fun the activity is, the more pressure we squeeze with.  
If we squeeze hard when the lemon is full, effort per juice is less, but to squeeze out the next few drops, the effort required is a lot. The same happens with doing highly dopaminergic activities in the morning when the dopamine store is full.  
Inversely, the daily chores/ not very fun activities also release small amounts of dopamine. Squeezing a little juice when lemon is full is really easy and so is doing not very fun work in the morning.  

# Guidelines
- Every day work also release dopamine, it is just it is much less and requires sensitivity to dopamine.  
- Avoid dopaminergic activities in the morning (first few hours).
- Make a list of activities to be done in the morning and attempt doing one of them before ever using the phone.
