If we do only 1 thing, we get bored. If we do too much, then we get overwhelmed.  
ADHD people are dynamic and excitable. we should structure our life based on this.  

```
Have 3 to 5 tasks which you can cycle.
```

After doing 1 thing for some time, we build tolerance to the novelty or initial burst of motivation, it wont be new anymore. But we dont always need **new**, we need **different**.  

## How
- Think of 3 to 5 hobbies or tasks or goals from the past or right now.  
- Start with 1 which seems most appealing. `What can you do concretely to proceed in the goal in the next 24 hours?`
- Start with 15 minute block. Dont limit to that if feeling inspired.  
- Let the excitement flow.
- It is inevitable that you **will** feel like not doing it and then let yourself procrastinate (*It's OK!*)
