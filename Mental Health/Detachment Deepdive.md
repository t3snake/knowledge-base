## Official Outline
- Detachment comes from the Sanskrit “Vairagya”
  - Vairagya comes from the Sanskrit root “vi,” – which means without, and rag, which means “passion, interest, attachment.”
  - So detachment means to be without interest, passion, or attachment. 
- What is the difference between dissociation and detachment
- The flow state -> stop being ourselves and merge with the work at hand
- What is apathy
- True detachment is having internal tranquility and recognizing that the world around you is separate from you.
  - What you can control
  - How to cultivate this attitude
- Future focus vs. present focus and karma phal
  - Devoting yourself to action, not the outcome
- Tat Tvam Asi - meditation practice
