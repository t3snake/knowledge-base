## What is your value at work?
Think in terms of ROI

## Being someone likable at work ie. Being Responsible
- Owning the outcome.
- Obstacle
	- Flagging the obstacle. (Dont tell when asked later)
	- Showing the plan and what you have tried. (thoughtfulness)
	- Ask for help or suggestions.
	- If you are responsible, it might become problematic since others start relying on you too much and become lazy. Help them a few times but set expectations. #todo 

## Dont be a one trick pony
Eg: Dont apologize all the time, once or twice is enough. If you do more then you create an image of incompetent/unreliable person.  
Eg: Dont make the same joke more than once or twice.  
Eg: Dont appreciate too much, be reserved and be authentic when you say.  
Eg: Taking a credit can happen by being grateful to someone.  

## Attitude
Venting / Complaint should only be done intentionally and rarely.  
Be aware if you are asking for others to fix it.  
Dont give feedback and criticism to people unless they ask for it.  
Ask what level of feedback and criticism, they want and also think through what someone can take.  

## Social Stuff

### Mentorship
It could be within work or outside work usually outside because internally it could be conflicting.
- Formal Mentor at work
- Professional Organization (outside work)
- Organically

Questions:  
Bad - Things that could be a google search. Information gathering. Generic questions  
Good - Things that require thinking. Specific to their expertise.  

Highly likely to be mentored when you are competend

### Meetings
Meetings are about feelings. Even if most emails
- Are we on the same page, alignment.
- Coordination
- Stay in touch
- Visibility -> you gain visibility, but don't take over by talking too much, because we deprive others of the limited time.
- Say only important things, more you say more it gets diluted.
- If you want to speak slightly raise hand (IRL) and use raise hand button in teams/meet.

### Problems and Communication
- Flag the problem
- Propose a solution and action plan
- Tether comms ie. say ahead of time: I will try to figure it out and lets touch base at EOD tommorow.

Demonstrates awareness, competence.

## Internal Work

### Dont look for justice
Life is unfair and we should not be looking for justness or fairness.  
People are 

### Confusing wants with prediction
I want to get a promotion -> I will get a promotion.
Prediction should be independant of wants.

### Comparison
There is a good reason humans compare. But be careful of ego. Dont attach value as a human when comparing. Comparison should show a way forward.  
Eg: I am better at skill compared to others should be the way forward.  

### Value or Ego
If sense of our value or self esteem should not be tied to work, it becomes healthy.  
Work is a source of pride and sense of value but that is not the only thing, dont let it be substitute for a lack of something else. Dont try to fix your low self esteem through work alone. You program your self esteem to be attached to work, so if work goes bad your self esteem worsens.  

### Realistic Expectations
Have realistic expectations. It comes from outside of you, from data/ analytics. The brain wont like it. Know what the odds are. If expectations are unrealistic, easy to get demotivated. When you know how bleak things are, and ego is not in the picture, it can turn on
