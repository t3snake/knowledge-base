Introverts like 1 on 1, make themselves invisible when it comes to leadership.  

There is lot of research and sources on being charismatic that looked at influencial figures such as Gandhi or Mao or Hitler. Religious figures were looked at such as Jesus, Krishna etc. There are business management sources on how to be a leader in the corporate world. There is psychology of Charisma. 

Unfortunately none of these explains how to apply this to a non charismatic person who is trying to be charismatic.

These properties are not useful to define or learn charisma.

Inspiration
This can be scientifically defined and can be measured when someone is inspired and thus can also reverse engineer into what was done to evoke inspiration.  

There are macro and micro skills that can be used to develop charisma.

# Communication Skills
This is the number one factor when it comes to charisma (attractiveness is only 4th place and accounts for 9%).  
*1st Macro Skill*
Key for this is repetition and practice of your understanding which clears your communication. See [[Communication 101]].  
Dr K wrote a book and manifesto before starting streaming and that is how he is good at communicating.

The frequently asked questions like "Tell me about yourself"  
Hint: Think about the questions that you hate most.  
Practice these questions, Journal, whether your answer is right or wrong does not matter, the most important thing is to practice these answers.  
IE. Rehearse the question to improve influency.

## Calm and Clear Vision
When looking at leadership in the corporate world, it is someone having a clear vision even if they do not have clear details.  
People latch on to people who have their shit figured out, people who have a clear vision.  

## Honest and Reliable
Big part of charisma is being authentic.  
A big problem about introverts: extroverts are ok with showing themselves or being on display. Introverts hate showing themselves because it causes discomfort. This causes them to hide themselves. Thus they cannot be authentic. Eg: being on their phone during a party.  
`You have to be seen to be your authentic self.`  

Thus the question now is how can we start being ok with being seen.
We need the following micro skills:
- Facial Expressions
- Choice of vocabulary
- Eye contact
These changes make people more charismatic by impacting their empathic circuitry.  
Psychopaths and Sociopaths actually use these techniques to be seen as more authentic.  

## Eye Contact
This is the biggest factor to improve as an introvert.  
Eye contact differentiates between loving and creepy eyes.  
As poets have said `Eye is the window to the soul`  
Eye contact can convey attention, threat, love etc.  
Also one way gay people can tell if the other person is gay.  

### Self Referential Processing
Moments like someone looks at you and you are like 'oh shit' and look away or you are looking at someone and they look at you and then you look away.  
This is due to self referential processing, we process how we look like in their eyes. This is also a mirror of how we look at ourself.  
The chain is as follows:  
`Perception of anothers attention -> Self referential processing -> Reciprocal attention or interaction.`  

Eg: If we are sloppy at our home by ourself, havent brushed our teeth, in pajamas etc. this is fine for us, but if someone walks in, it triggers lot of thoughts like ohh shoot or I was not ready to be seen like this.  

If we are introverts lot of these thoughts during self referential processing are **negative** and since humans are empathic, the other party can feel these negative thoughts too.  
This conveys lack of authenticity, there is no clarity of vision, there is no calmness and certainly there is no clear communication. When you look away, charisma goes out the window.  

When some one looks away both parties feel awkward in some way, on the flip side the general advice during speeches is to rotate eye contact with different people. What happens is there is an empathetic connection between you and the one you are in eye contact with and other people feel this through empathic circuitry.

To deal with this self referential processing, we can do the following:

#### Deal with negative thoughts
During self referential processing, negative thoughts come up such as my how does my hair look, is there something on my teeth, I feel embarassed about my weight etc.

One way to do this is to **unburden** our self referential processing so lookmaxxing. Do a nice hair cut, go to the gym and get fit.

Other thing is feeling like a loser in others eye is not because there is a property of a loser in us but it is how we carry ourselves and others can empathetically feel it. So we become losers because we project loserness through empathy.  

Exercise: what thoughts come up when you are seen? work on those thoughts.  

CBT Therapy also helps challenge these negative thoughts. We dont need to fix 100 %, this is just a good way to start.  

## Summary for Macro skills

These account for 40% of charisma

- Rehearse your answers
- Develop your life purpose
- Begin to love yourself/ neutrality?

These account for 20%

- Eye contact
- Self referential processing

The rest are microscopic skills

## Microscopic skills

### Learn to make eye contact
Practice when walking down the street. This will feel very to extremely awkward. We also dont have to do it well, we just need to do exposure therapy.

![[Distress Tolerance chart.png]]
The more exposure we have the lower we go and the less discomfort we feel, near the end this will become natural.  
At the bottom of the chart, we become calm and visionary, honest and reliable and the other metrics of charisma.  
This also turns off trigger of self referential processing as you praactice more.  

Practically you need to practice with following tips:
- Practice eye contact with strangers, choose someone who is not possibly going to be a mate.
- Smile or give a nod, try not to do eye brows, dont wink

### Being ok with interrupting and bowl over conversation
We need to learn from extroverts who are self absorbed and bowl over conversation completely oblivious of your distress signal.  

Dont wait for time to talk, just start talking.
Tip: `Can I jump in for a second?`  
Over time we need to build distress tolerance with using these skills (like previous section)

A lot of times we have a cool point to add to the conversation which migh win us some points. We cant wait 6 to 8 minutes until the topic is done.
