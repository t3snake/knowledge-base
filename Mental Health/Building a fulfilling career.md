## Part 1


## Part 2
Dont outsource your growth to your job, only you are responsible for this.  
Understand what the job is: getting payment for work done and thats all, for retention they may give opportunities for growth but it is just an add on, only you are responsible.  

If you want mentorship: potential, willingness is ok but having already put in the work and then asking for help is the correct job.  
Interested in doing vs actually doing stuff.  

### Growth vs Advancement
Growth = Level up, Advancement = Title/world sees your skills
I can level up on my own, but job doesnt pay more for that if I go ask for raise if I levelled up. Have empathy for employer, put yourself in their shows and ask what they want and need. This will clarify burnout.
Eg: mid level job listing named as entry level, have empathy and understand that they are trying to low ball. (empathy not always about positive, its not compassion or kindness)

Advancement: Give your employer what they want.
Growth: Advancement of skills. Internal

Growth need not matter in my jobs. Statitistics: Move every 2 years, move to a place where growth will be rewarded.  

Advancement for career > growth and reverse engineer for fulfillment

Reverse Engineer Dream job (Frontal lobe stuff) 
Build amazing 3d platformer game    (what do i need to do before this step)
Get a job at nintendo
find people at linkedin and ask what they did 

Mnemic Effect
some of this stuff is boring
Put in negative as way to move to positive.

I hate doing my resume > if i want dream job it is necessary step.

### Internal Work
Lot of stuff you will loathe on the way to your dream job.  
The fact that there is work to do like applying to 1000 jobs and that affects me internally , Im fkd.  
Take 1 day at a time (eg: if jobless > apply to 40 jobs in day)
Not having fun is the price you pay to get what you want.

Job stuff > look at karma perspective > apply job and clear the negative karma of past choices. Even if karma is not real, it works out, if you stop letting it affect your action.

Avoid trash diet of the internet.
