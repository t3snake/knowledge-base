## How Speech Works in Brain
Left Hemisphere of the Brain is where speech comes from.  
These are the parts of our brain responsible for speech:
- **Broca's Area**  
  Governs Speech production, Syntax, Fluency, finding words.  
  If someone had stroke in this area, they would sound weird and in wrong order.
  They would call a mug a liquid holder.
- **Wernicke's Area**  
  Governs Speech reception.
  If someone had stroke in this area, they would not be able to comprehend. (They might here sounds but not words).  
- **Auditory Association Cortex**
  First time we hear new words we dont know what that means. This adds meaning to words. For example triggered by words happens through here.  
- **Limbic system**
  Where we experience emotions. In emotional state, this affects the above areas.
- **Frontal Lobes** ACC and mPFC
  Monitors our speech.  

## Process of Speech
Order of process:
- Conception of what you want to say.
- Syntax
- Word choice

If we want to be fluid this process needs to be unconcious or subconcious.  
We cant be thinking if we want to be fluid.  
We have a writer and an editor in our brain, we cant be fluid if both are getting engaged at the same time. Writer is a creator and Editor is analytical. If we speak while thinking we are writing and editing at the same time.  

Clear speech comes from clear thought. Unclear thought leads to unclear speech.  

1. Writing  
   One way to have clear thought is to write. Writing and giving it multiple passes is a good way to improve thought and speech.
2. Think about your Audience  
   Broca's area does what you tell it to do, thats how it knows which words to pick. "What are the goals of this?" kind of big picture needs to be defined, the more it is defined, the easier it is for parts of the brain to figure out the words. Eg: If you have convo with GF, we might think the goal of convo is for us but most likely it is to specifically express my thoughts or understanding the other party.
3. Think about your intention, goal of the conversation  
   #todo Brain will align if the intention and goal is clear.
4. Use your emotions to your advantage  
   Negative emotions can influence parts of the brain that influence speech, thus that needs to be taken care of but also you can be emotionally stable and use that to be authentic and impactful in speech
5. Wrong perception  
   Wrong perception can influence speech and cause hampering of clear speech. #todo
