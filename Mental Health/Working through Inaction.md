## Tools and Framework
Why action is hard?  
Watching videos != Action.  
Info pipeline: Sensory organ -> associated cortex -> thalamus -> hippocampus.  
Actions pipeline: Frontal lobes, ACC
There needs to be a pipeline from hippocampus to frontal lobes to turn info into action.  
Sometimes people can repeat information from their short term memory, but that information is not part of the calculation that brain makes. Like people who are chronically late

This can be done by following:

### Manipulation of information
Making life easy is a bad idea. Summaries dont allow you to manipulate information.  
Babies do this when they drop things, they are playing with gravity to understand.  

- Apply it  
  To apply it you need to manipulate info to fit the context.  
  In video games, if you just follow meta, you dont really understand, you need to manipulate the info and apply it. Following others meta like watching youtube will not make us understand. Dont use other peoples meta build since unlike games each person has unique genes, experiences etc.  

### Repetition  
You need to repeat a concept 6 times, the absorption increases with more repetition.
We need to space out over time. We do this when we are kids, and also through out schooling. For complete absorption repetition is necessary.  
  ```
  Absorption
  |      o
  |     o
  |_o_______
	Repetition
  ```

### Stretch your capacity/learning
If we try to make life too easy, we will actually make it hard.  
We need to stretch our limits. We need to try and grasp, understanding or not (outcome) is not important, it is the struggle and difficult that is important.  
It feels bad but that is growth. When a video makes it easy, this does not happen.  
Difficulty is where growth is. If it is easy, it is insufficient since that is how we got here.  
Difficulty is really `encoding` in your brain, thats how you wrap difficult concepts in your head. (Think school time)  

### Salience - Importance and Relevance
You might think you want something and you still dont do it, that is because it is not that important/relevant to you, it is only important in some abstract sense.  
A powerful desire is not salience. If you want something it might just be a strong desire.  
Importance can look like `salience` (relevant) or `attachment` (want it/ need it). Attachment if it leads to negative emotion, you will start avoiding it.  

Ask why is something important for you? Ignore the first 3 answers since that is how you got here. Then ask "how is it relevant to me"  
Eg: doing an extra subject, most people dont care, for some it is relevant because they need As in all to get into competitive field so they give the extra subject extra care because it is relevant to their ambitions.  
Eg: I am doing this dead end job because it is a stepping stone to a better one.  

### Novelty
Likely to absorb more when things are new.  
One way to do it is introduce novelty to tasks.  
How to make things novel? Figure it out, stretch your limits, dont use other peoples meta.  

### Stillness of the mind
When the mind is still, information sinks in deeper.  
Traumatized kids have still minds on their abusive parents, they are fully tuned in to their parent to detect the smallest fluctuation, in this state the learning goes deep.  
How to make your mind still? Meditation, Salience, Novelty.  

## How to order tasks

### Axes over your head
Deal with the `axes over your head: The tasks that make it difficult to do other tasks`. The huge tasks *looming* over you that you are afraid of.  
Spiritual perspective: looming axes are your karma, you just have to go through it. Accept that it will suck and there is no way to avoid the suck `Do you want to be ahead of this task or behind it?`  
This tasks hanging over you makes it harder to do other tasks.  
Getting over it gives sense of freedom and release. Cleanse the debuff.  
Eg: Uhh I need to get an extension for this paper. The action itself is not important, its putting it behind us that is important.  
The reason to act is not to finish or progress but to put it behind you.  

### Cherries on top
#todo
**Do the moderately important soul nourishing task second in the morning instead of the moderately important soul sucking tasks (work)**. The soul nourishing task require a full tank. The moderately important tasks get done in last minute panic in a short time anyway.  
Doing what you love requires you get over the dreadful stuff, because you need a full tank.  

## Shaping your environment
*Body and mind is not you but your environment*, we need to shape these environments.  Body and mind wants to do things, not things that you want to do.  

We need to shape both internal and external environment.  
External environment influences internal environment through #indriyas internal senses which turn into desires for you.  
We can clean up out internal environment by cleaning our external environment.  
Phones for eg are trying (not necessarily to mind control) to shape internal environment and induce desires.  
`We can either shape our external environment (which brain doesnt like) or let it influence internal environment and have a fight internally with willpower`
The second option is what most people do, which is why they desire more willpower.  
*Separate work and pleasure*

Being motivated by do or die is because it changes our internal environment.  

### Rest, Recreation and Distraction
Rest and Recreation are good ideas, distraction is a bad idea for our environment.  
`The way we dont take action is critical for our future actions.`  
The way we dont act also wires inside our brain, making it harder to act in the future if we use distraction.  

Eg: using phone ie. distraction is not only means of avoiding the task that has to be done, the depleted dopamine reserves means that it is extremely hard to do tasks and also when you finally do a task we dreaded, we dont even get reinforcement to do more of it.  
We can have 2 different reaction to finish a task that we dreaded:  
- Thank god it is over, I am glad I dont have to do this anymore, anxiety is gone, went from -100 to 0.  
- Lets go, I did it, I did a really good job.  
Both requires same effort and it is the same action. The difference is how much dopamine we have.  

Distraction also suppresses negative #emotions. What we suppress, becomes intense. This creates a cycle when negative emotions intensifies, more we distract, which causes more suppression of emotions and ...  

`The difference between recreation and distraction is when we finish that do we have more energy or less`  
Gaming could be either recreation or distraction when we understand .

Get rid of the distraction (hard to do) or ask yourself *Do I want this for myself tomorrow?*  

### Emotion Cultivation
What kind of emotions are we cultivating?  

`What we hide within us, intensifies`  
When there is a great idea and motivation, build it ; dont not talk about it ie. hide it, or else we will lose the motivation. When there is negative emotion or burden, we should talk about it and get rid of it.  

One reason we struggle with negative emotion: when we face emotionally challenging situation, we think about it. If we think about it, try to solve it, we are paralyzing ourselves.  

We want to solve a problem without paying the price.  
We should reframe to for some action, *we have to pay a price*.  
We can either feel good or take action.  
Eg: I want to breakup without making them feel bad: this is hard. Breakup + make them feel bad is easy, not breaking up + not make them feel bad also is easy.  
Easiest price we pay is emotional suffering. Face negative emotions, and cultivate positive emotions.  
*Listen to music and use the emotional activation* but dont listen to music all day and desensitize yourself.  
We need to tie positive emotion with action for good results, dont let it go away without acting.  

## External Frontal lobe
#frontal_lobe  
If there is too much in our mind, it is hard to act. Sometimes it is because of emotion overwhelm, but mostly it is executive function.  
Holding into too many things is occupying your RAM. Externalize it. This recruits senses, increases likelihood to act. If it is too much it can be overwhelming. (see above: manipulate this information, stretch your capacity)  
Best organization system is the one that you make, not something we read about.  
Use calendars and timers.  

## Goal management training
Originally made for ADHD.  
We usually start immediately when we get an impulse. When we give in to impulse to start, we train our impulse to stop.
**Stop before acting** Dont start immediately. Think about what we are going to do.  
**Defining the main goal and scope** This shows rusty frontal lobes.  
When will I stop?  
**Break up the goal to 2 to 5 pieces** before getting started.  
**Check in. Artificially induce a pause** Take a break for 10 mins but keep it in your mind.  
Am I staying on task or not? (ans not important, it is checking in)
**Reflect**: When we finish a task, we react by just forgetting about it, we should reflect and it might feel painful, but we should feel it, will make us feel better tommorow.  
How did I do? What am I going to do next time? (dont have vague answer, the first ans in your head > discard it)  
This is difficult, we have to rewire into a different person. *We will feel bad, but we should act despite it* and that will lead to freedom. Bad emotion is a good thing.  

**Dont confuse lack of progress with a lack of progress**  
We rewire every day, sometimes in bad ways. Result wise it may not look like progress but we do make process in either a good or bad way.  

## Gunas
#gunas  
- Tamas #tamas supresses action. Laziness.  
- Rajas #rajas acting a lot and not feeling good. If I am excited a lot slow down.  
  If I have wired myself to impulse, if impulse goes away we cant act.  
  *Practice inaction when we have impulse to act* This is easier to Practice action when we dont have an impulse.  
- Sattva #sattva is balance.  

Different food influences this, caffeine affects our batteries. Weed, alcoholic etc is tamsic. Stimulant meds are rajsic.  
Change what you eat.  
Pick a loss: eat hamburger, feel bad **or** eat oatmeal and feel hungry.  

Measure energy level and try different things. What drains your energy and what fills energy?  
Take a paper, rate energy level in the morning and then see later in the day and next day.  
Action easy -> Life hard... Action hard -> Life easy. Eg: take elevator, makes hard to take stairs.  

## How to apply knowledge
Decide what to try and what to discard.  
For the things to try: When, where, why?  
When we do this: reflect  

## Pratyahara and Dharana
It is not inaction, we act a lot but in unproductive action.  
*We need to unmotivate ourselves from crappy action.*  
#pratyahara sensory withdrawal practice.  
Resist impulse to take your phone, feel the desire and feel our inner self moving toward the impules.  
If you feel like a burger, order grilled chicken.  
If you feel like brushing with right hand, do it with your left hand.  
Unburden yourself, limit your options, it becomes easier to 

## Dealing with despair and overwhelm
**Despair** is the natural, evolutionary energy conserving response when we look into the future.  
**Overwhelm** is here I am now and I am getting attacked by things currently. Too much to handle right now. If we act in any way, other things will get worse. Cant afford to act.  

Both cases negative emotions trying to induce inaction.  

These things have to do with us, judgement of ourselves.  
Thoughts that populate our mind are reflection of our wiring, not truth.  
It is not about we dont know what to do are how to do, it is that what we do will be insufficient. Only way to move forward is through action.  
Accelerate to incomplete and insufficient action. Accelerate to hindsight. Hindsight is 20/20 foresight is 0/10 so accelerate to the hindsight.  
If we think of problem free solution, we will not act.  
`Learn go by losing 50 games quickly`.  
**Dont hypothesize about capability, test it**  
**Information does not precede action, Action is information**  
**When there is only one option (last minute) It is much easier to act**  

## Procrastination
2 ways this presents:
- Emotional Avoidance  
  Inaction is a protection against emotional hurt.  
  Eg: If I ask someone out, I could get rejected. Thus inaction. Then a competing negative emotion like desperation comes in and pushes us to action, but now we have wired to act in desperation.  

- Operational Fuzziness  
  Good phrase: "What do I need to learn to get started?".  
  If I need to get from A to Z and I dont know fully how to get there, Inaction arises.  
  #todo refer other materials covered to help with this.  

One way to procrastinate is in a good way. I dont wanna do task, dont do it but do something else in your list which is not distraction. Doing this is sattvic and will energize you tomorrow.  

## Concepts
Sometimes understanding is flipping of switch.  
Sometimes it is gradual and there is a tipping point where it comes together.  

### Impose Limits and Challenges
Limits and challenges increases action. (Codecrafters, Game Jams)  

###  Be Brutal with Commitments
Bring it on and let the obstacles come.  
*Obstacle is price we pay for forward movement.*  
If we are flexible with commitments then there is no value to commitment.  
We have to reduce commitments with other people, we do this a lot and we should not let us do this to ourselves.  

### Never pray for an easier life
Pray for the strength to go through the obstacles.  

### Acting when you are tired
"So What" works with non body tiredness (Sleep Apnea, Insulin Resistance, Chronic Fatigue)    
Tiredness and Energy are not the same things.  

If you dont listen to brains signal of tiredness, you might get a second wind when brain understands that signal wont work.  

### Just one more for work instead of game
One unit is good enough to extend.

### Degrees of Freedom
Will some action restrict freedom or increase freedom tomorrow?  
What can I do to increase freedom tomorrow?  
What can I avoid that restricts my freedom tomorrow?  

### Building your inheritance
Everyday you are a new consciousness that wakes in the body, we are a different person.  
You can make the future you's life harder and make them hate you **OR** you can make it easier for future you and like the decision in hindsight.  
We take a loan against future energy and paying a high interest rate.  

### Work when you are inspired
If it happens at night, just do the work.  Dont wait for tomorrow and possibly regret not acting when inspired.  

### When does the day end
The day does not end when you sleep, it ends when you retreat. Even if you vow to return later.  
When you take the last productive action, thats when the end of the day is.  
The action that I need to to take is before the end of the day. Maybe it is before you clock into the work.
