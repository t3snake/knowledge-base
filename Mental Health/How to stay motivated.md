## Experience of 100% Effort
When we are putting forth 100% effort, our emotion is in alignment with the task. Like if parents say you cant do what you want to, and you are angry and do it anyway, the anger is in alignment with the task.  
For energy, to put 100% effort there is enough energy.  

## Experience of lack of effort
For lack of 100% effort, our experience *not feeling like it* or *today I dont have the energy today, probably will tomorrow*. It is a feeling (emotion) and not a conclusion.  

## Cultivating emotion
Eg: Dance opportunity: 2 ways to react:
- I am excited, I cant believe it, I cant wait
- I am not a good dancer, I will look like an idiot

#ego   
This is ego. In both cases, you could be a beginner and both might look like idiots.  
The emotional reaction comes from our sense of identity.

## Science of arousal
We have the #hpa HPA axis (Hypothalamus Pituitary Adrenal axis) which governs our energy and arousal. Our energy and stress changes based on our opinion of the task.  

To have optimal energy for a task we need medium levels of stress (eustress).  

When task is low stress, our energy reduces. This scenario is boredom. Eg: paperwork is not difficult, just annoying. Even though the task is easy, the effort is very high because our energy is low.  

When task is high stress, our energy tanks. This scenario is overwhelm. Our brain goes *This task is too much to handle, we will not succeed, thus we should not waste energy*

We can influence the stress for a task and it depends on our sense of identity.  
If you think a task is beneath you, you will feel it is boring.  
If you feel this task is very new, *This is too much, I dont know anything*. Your perception makes it overwhelming. If we thought, *I dont know this but I will do my best / I want to learn* we would not be as overwhelmed.  

## Solution
We could go to 15 weeks of psychotherapy.  
Psychedelics is another option but not recommended.  

From spiritual perspective, this can be fixed by fixing ego.

### Exercise
- Take a task where cant put 100% effort
- Either *dont feel like it* or *dont have energy*
- Take either of these and trace it back to sense of your identity
- What is it about me (attribute of me) that makes me feel it, Others can do it but I cant
- Accuracy and Correctness is not important, a simple statement is enough
- Sit up straight
- 5 min of Ohm Chanting (Optional)
- Look within yourself for the attribute of yourself
- Thoughts are not real, so ignore what you think
- Let the attribute go when you realize that it is not there within you
