Discipline is having 1 thought for extended periods of time.  
ADHD is having multiple thoughts.  
Habit -> 0 thoughts.  

## Willpower
Willpower is the part of our brain that monitors conflict. We dont run out of will power it is we throw in the towel or stop monitoring the conflict. We kind of decide and then justifications start happening.  
You dont have to win you just have to wait it out.  
Giving up = Stop paying attention. **Dont stop paying attention**  

## Desire
Gym vs FF7. How much willpower do I need to go to gym, it depends on desire to play FF7.  
Discipline is easy when I dont care. Hard when I care about the alternative.  
**Reduce desire** -> easy to be disciplined.  
Ads exist to create thoughts. Desire starts from our senses (*Indriyas*) like sight.  

To decrease indriya input which is negative:
- Notifications
- Silence discord etc notifications
- No face id
- Manual login for shitty things -> twitter, instagram, youtube?
- Clutter in room  
  If there are 100 things in the room, thalamus processes it and brings 1 to your attention but takes processing power to filter out the remaining 99. Studying and focusing is easier when room is not cluttered.

Positive indriya input  
sometimes brains of people with ADHD will create sensory input if deprived of senses. They might focus better with music / white noise and meditate better with half gaze instead of completely closing their eyes.  
Community (*Sangha*) can also help (for eg: community like group doing HIIT: CULT?)

## Detachment
(*Vairagya*) or [[Detachment]]  
Care less about the thing that makes you undisciplined. Control attachment to your desire.
