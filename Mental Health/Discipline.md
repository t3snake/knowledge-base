Discipline is having 1 thought for extended periods of time.  
ADHD is having multiple thoughts.  
Habit -> 0 thoughts.  

## Willpower
Willpower is the part of our brain that monitors conflict. We dont run out of will power it is we throw in the towel or stop monitoring the conflict. We kind of decide and then justifications start happening.  
You dont have to win you just have to wait it out.  
Giving up = Stop paying attention. **Dont stop paying attention**  

## Desire
Gym vs FF7. How much willpower do I need to go to gym, it depends on desire to play FF7.  
Discipline is easy when I dont care. Hard when I care about the alternative.  
**Reduce desire** -> easy to be disciplined.  
Ads exist to create thoughts. Desire starts from our senses (*Indriyas*) like sight.  

To decrease indriya input which is negative:
- Notifications
- Silence discord etc notifications
- No face id
- Manual login for shitty things -> twitter, instagram, youtube?
- Clutter in room  
  If there are 100 things in the room, thalamus processes it and brings 1 to your attention but takes processing power to filter out the remaining 99. Studying and focusing is easier when room is not cluttered.

Positive indriya input  
sometimes brains of people with ADHD will create sensory input if deprived of senses. They might focus better with music / white noise and meditate better with half gaze instead of completely closing their eyes.  
Community (*Sangha*) can also help (for eg: community like group doing HIIT: CULT?)

## Detachment
(*Vairagya*) or [[Detachment]]  
Care less about the thing that makes you undisciplined. Control attachment to your desire.  

Nucleus Accumbens *NAcc* does 3 things:
- Dopamine released gives us rush of pleasure
- Behavior reinforcement (creates desire)
- Increase anticipation (craving)

If we want to use this to our advantage we need to savour the moments of discipline. Increase desire for action that requires discipline:  

What usually happens after period of hard work (like exams) is like fuck yeah lets go party, order a pizza, play a game etc. The brain associates reward with the pleasure but the hard work as pain. We take the joy out of hard work it becomes 2 separate things to the brain.  

So after doing the thing we want to be disciplined for: Sit down for 15 mins, appreciate it, dont go right at the distraction. Say fuck yeah! Recap what you did. Enjoy it.

This could make Gym (50 unit desire) vs FF7 (50 unit desire). 1 unit willpower needed to do Gym. It is struggle for undisciplined people and easy for disciplined people to choose the gym over video game.  

Alternatively we can reduce desire of FF7 to 40 then 30 (and so on) units of desire by detachment.  
One simple way to cultivate detachment is to analyze desire.  
FFRIs show 1 truth that not all parts of the brain get blood equally at the same time. Either NAcc is active or the analytical part of the brain. You can either laugh at the joke or understand/dissect it, you cannot do both.  

It is a waiting game, you will always win the waiting game over desire, desire will try to get you to cave in quickly.

## Meditations
- Trataka
- Antara Trataka
- Yantra Trataka

When we look at something for extended period of time, pigments run out, we look around to reegenerate different pigments. If we exhaust pigments looking at something and close our eyes (**Antar Trataka**) we see a negative image of what we saw. Maintaining this requires the right level of focus. If focus too hard or less, the image disappears. It requires a relaxed focus.

## Analyze Desire
Observe before, during and after. I really want to eat this/ play this >> What is it like before, during and after. We are recruiting different part of the brain (from FMRI analogy), reducing savouring of the experience and desire goes away.

For the things we want to be disciplined above, we shsould savour it.

## Mandala Practice
Everyone does action for some benefit, we need to practice action that has no benefit.
**Mandala** is the practice of making a pattern like rangoli and destroying it.  
Separate action from the outcome, leads to easier action. Resistance to starting an action comes from being attached to the outcome. If no benefit, reluctant to act etc.

## Quadrants
```
         Internal
            |
   *Duty*   |  *Desire*
            |
Loss -------+--------- Gain
            |
*Shoulds*   |  *Values*
            |
         External
```

Desire and Shoulds dont lead to discipline.  
Duty and Values leads to discipline.  

## Habit - Action w/o Effort
Discipline is consistent action but doesnt need to be consistent effort.  
- It takes 2 - 4 weeks to form. Being too ambitious is the biggest mistake.  
  25% rule: If want to meditate 20 minutes -> make goal as 5 minutes to start.  
- Anchor new habit to existing behavior/habit.  
- While forming habit, for the initial 2 to 4 weeks, do it no matter what happens, timescale may demotivate you "dont want to do this forever", We only want to do it for 2 weeks no matter what, then we can give up.  
- Smooth the path, Anticipate the resistance (eg: you take mail everyday while coming back home, but sometimes coworker drops you and you are embarassed to ask them to stop). Make it easy for yourself to be successful.
- Study the habit. Analyze/Autopsy: What went wrong, What went right, Where can I do better
```
Note: Habit circuitry is governed by Endo cannabinoid system. MJ also acts on that and will mess with the system.
```

## Karma Perspective
You wake up as a different person everyday.  
By indulging today, you screw the future you who is different.  
Ask: How do I want to wake up tomorrow? Having done the task or the task looming over me.  
Todays actions will not help us today (dopamine does) it will help in the future. It is a gift from todays self to future self (compared to indulging today to screw up future self)
