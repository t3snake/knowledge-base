# Intro
Their are primal emotions that even crocodiles feel such as fear and anger.  
Social emotions that require other people such as pride and shame.  

It comes from amygdala the negative emotion centre of the brain. Anger and fear both originate from the same place based on assessment. If the threat is unbeatable we feel fear, if it is beatable then we feel anger.  

Anger comes from threat to your boundary or diminishing of some patterns.
Anger wipes the state clean and you forget everything (pure anger can make you forget about everything almost like ego death).

Anger gives a single solution which we assume at the time is the only solution. We should take a step back and see the origin of the anger and devise a few more plans of action and choose the most appropriate one rather than the first default option. We should maintain our anger during this process since anger is a good source of motivation and information. (It is neither good or bad)

# Patterns of Brain
Ask yourself how you are being violated when you feel angry. Use following framework:
*What is being violated/diminished*:  
**Freedom**: Controlled, dominated, exploited  
**Function**: Disabled, immobile, restricted (takes away ability to function)  
**Resources**: Robbed, Cheated  
**Relationship**: Rejected, Ostrasized  
**Self Esteem**: Insulted, Small  
**Efficacy**: Misled, Thwarted, Jebaited  
**Security**: Exposed, Vulnerable (space: crash on couch and doesnt leave, leaves you insecure)  
**Physical**: Assaulted, Violated  

Anger is personalized and ego driven. For there to be territory, there has to be "me".
