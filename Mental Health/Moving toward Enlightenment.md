Enlightenment seems to be forever happiness/contentment. There doesnt seem to be much evidence for this. Research on hapiness just gives circumstance, not always actionable.  
Money buys security which is an antidote to unhappiness that comes from no security but doesnt scale with happiness.  

Here are steps toward "more permanent happiness":

## Stop chasing Dopamine
#dopamine  
With release of dopamine comes pleasure and anticipation but also adaptation or tolerance. Thus doing the same fun activity becomes less fun over time.  
Then some people like me rotate different sources: weed, food, video game, watch anime. This never leads to sustained happiness. 

## Dissolve Ego
#ego  
Default Mode Network #dnf : when this is active, we are thinking about themselves. Eg: depression, even if something is fixed, DNF is still active there will be something new to focus on. Eg: getting more facial surgery.  
Fixing depression is not through always solving problems but through #ketamine which is a dissociative agent. #psychedelics do the same. Also meditation.  

## Live in the present
Brain is a bit screwed by default, lives in the future (and the past). We can feel hypothetical pain but not hypothetical pleasure. We can feel fear, guilt, shame etc. from a future outcome. 
We dont feel pain of one bad outcome, we feel pain of 100 bad outcomes.

Experiment: Get 100$ now or have 50% chance of getting 200$.  
We always value loss more than gain ie. guaranteed 100$. Here the loss ie. getting nothing (future hypothetical) is painful.  
Monks figured out that future is a rigged game so live in the present.  
Eg: Casinos implement this very well, they implement it in a way that dimension of time is gone. If people thought about future pain, they would gamble a lot less.

## One pointedness of the mind
People who suffer have two tracked mind.  
Eg: social anxious person on a date, the one track is being in the experience, the other track is commentary on the experience: what if they dont  like me etc.
