## Notes
Big Ideas, Big Dreams  
Cant tolerate the boring, drab, normal life  
Waiting for the right circumstance to ignite manic state where they can work really hard  
Inferiority complex while feeling superior in some way  
Cant commit  

Root cause: Cant close any doors in life, if they do they feel trapped.

Solution: Close doors in life. Not closing any door in life leads to the exact life they don't want.
What to choose if I like all of the possibilities? Dice roll, whatever I choose I like, then its not a trap.

Avoid working hard being hijacked by Hero complex.

## Official Takeaways
- The Puer/Puella Aeternus is an archetype originally developed by Carl Jung to describe individuals who remain eternal children, struggling to mature and engage with adult responsibilities.
- These individuals can be brilliant and capable of intense work when enthusiastic, but productivity drops when tasks become mundane, avoiding routine.
- A core trait is refusing responsibility, even going to extreme lengths to avoid it.
- They fear losing their potential, living in a fantasy of possibilities, and avoiding the "drab existence" of reality.

## Official Growth
If you feel like you might be a Puer or Puella Aeternus, you must practice embracing ordinary ordinary life. Growth involves engaging with the mundane because the inability to do so is what keeps you stuck.

- **Embrace responsibility by facing discomfort** and stepping into the unknown.
- **Engage with reality by committing to something** that aligns with growth and responsibility. Trust that clarity will come through action.
- **Build structure into your life and discipline yourself** to choose actions that move you forward in life versus indulgent activities.
- **Confront unresolved childhood experiences**, like over-dependence, to help you recognize avoidant tendencies.
- **Reconnect with your body to anchor you in reality.** This helps to regulate your nervous system and diminish negative emotions.
- **Move in the direction of your fears**, and put your talents and efforts in service of something greater. This helps you overcome built-up internal resistance to moving forward in life.
