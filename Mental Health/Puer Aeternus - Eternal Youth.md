## Notes
Big Ideas, Big Dreams  
Cant tolerate the boring, drab, normal life  
Waiting for the right circumstance to ignite manic state where they can work really hard  
Inferiority complex while feeling superior in some way  
Cant commit  

Root cause: Cant close any doors in life, if they do they feel trapped.

Solution: Close doors in life. Not closing any door in life leads to the exact life they don't want.
What to choose if I like all of the possibilities? Dice roll, whatever I choose I like, then its not a trap.

Avoid working hard being hijacked by Hero complex.

## Official Takeaways
- The Puer/Puella Aeternus is an archetype originally developed by Carl Jung to describe individuals who remain eternal children, struggling to mature and engage with adult responsibilities.
- These individuals can be brilliant and capable of intense work when enthusiastic, but productivity drops when tasks become mundane, avoiding routine.
- A core trait is refusing responsibility, even going to extreme lengths to avoid it.
- They fear losing their potential, living in a fantasy of possibilities, and avoiding the "drab existence" of reality.

## Official Growth
If you feel like you might be a Puer or Puella Aeternus, you must practice embracing ordinary ordinary life. Growth involves engaging with the mundane because the inability to do so is what keeps you stuck.

- **Embrace responsibility by facing discomfort** and stepping into the unknown.
- **Engage with reality by committing to something** that aligns with growth and responsibility. Trust that clarity will come through action.
- **Build structure into your life and discipline yourself** to choose actions that move you forward in life versus indulgent activities.
- **Confront unresolved childhood experiences**, like over-dependence, to help you recognize avoidant tendencies.
- **Reconnect with your body to anchor you in reality.** This helps to regulate your nervous system and diminish negative emotions.
- **Move in the direction of your fears**, and put your talents and efforts in service of something greater. This helps you overcome built-up internal resistance to moving forward in life.

## Evidence Based Approach
There is an overlap between ADHD and Puer, but ADHD does not completely map with Puer, Puer shows as ADHD, Avoidant attachment, C-PTSD and other issues.  
- Talk to professional
- EQ -> self awareness, emotional regulation ...

## Classic Approach
Individual has a concious mind and unconcious mind. The concious part gets thoughts we are aware of but also other thoughts that comes out of nowhere. This comes from the unconscious mind specifically from the archetype. Mind providing fantastical solutions to ordinary problems is an example of unwanted thought that comes from the puer archetype.

There are lot of conflicts in the unconscius mind and only roughly 3/10 problems rise to the conscious mind. CBT mostly applies to the conscious mind.
Yogis went deeper than mind and did not care about the unconscious mind. Purify mind completely by deleting ego, dont need to fix specific issues.  

There are 3 Layers:
- Conscious
- Unconscious / Archetype
- Tattva (Quality) / Universe

Tattva projects to unconscious and material. Unconscious projects to the conscious.  

Qualities of Puer:
- Loss of potential
- Very careful about time
- narrowing of possibilities
- Loathing general work

(Shadow Work) Question to ask: where did you learn  ...  
- that time is limited?  
- that you cant afford to commit?  
- to loathe general work? -> here ADHD and parents might be the reason  

What puer really needs to do is substitute thinking with experience, get more data.  
Giving it your all (devastating) ---> Picking yourself up (wonderful). This might be reality but we just thinking about giving it your all and failing would be devastating and never see it through the end.  
Fear of the thing is more problematic than the actual thing.  

## Spiritual Approach

- Puer has a big Ahamkara issue.  
I dont wanna travel the world, I wanna be a person that travels the world.  
I want to be in shape vs I want to be a person who is in shape.  
I want that, I am ... its all ego.  
If you lose ego, goodbye puer.  

- Puer has a big issue with time (Kaal?)  
Forever, how much time, ... is all issue with time.  
Unpleasantness is not just that but its unpleasantness forever which causes inaction.
