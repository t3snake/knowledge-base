Big Ideas, Big Dreams  
Cant tolerate the boring, drab, normal life  
Waiting for the right circumstance to ignite manic state where they can work really hard  
Inferiority complex while feeling superior in some way  
Cant commit  

Root cause: Cant close any doors in life, if they do they feel trapped.

Solution: Close doors in life. Not closing any door in life leads to the exact life they don't want.
What to choose if I like all of the possibilities? Dice roll, whatever I choose I like, then its not a trap.

Avoid working hard being hijacked by Hero complex.
