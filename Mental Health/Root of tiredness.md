Negative to neutral to positive path is impaired if avoiding negative is the motivation since cant move from neutral to positive.  

Curiosity drives behavior. Phone clicking links, looking it up is easy solution for curiosity, cant do longer form of pursuit for satisfying curiosity. If not curious then we feel tired.  

Level of actual energy and feeling tired are different things. Perception feeds tiredness, is brains calculation to conserve energy or avoid behavior.  

## Spirituality

Weekend is a concept made from unhealthy week. In other animals there are no weekends
if you take good rest and decide your own time, you dont need weekends.  

### Karma
Karma is basically action -> consequence. Doesn't mean balancing good and bad, doesn't care about good and bad.  
Eg. depressed didn't take care of health, now even if it wasn't your fault, you will face the consequences of the inaction during depression.
Bad karma leads to tiredness. If you smoke/drink, you will face consequences the next day, tired for half of the day. If you eat unprocessed food, you will feel full and tired.  
Think like maintaining a garden, if you take care it will be nice, if you don't take care it will wilt.  
If you avoid negativity, you will face the consequences. Embrace negativity, no point of avoiding other than short term relief, still takes cpu cycles in your head.
