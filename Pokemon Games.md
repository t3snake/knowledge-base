1. Yellow would give you the most faithful representation of a Gen 1 game and is most complete out of Red, Green, Blue & Yellow. Fire Red/Leaf Green is Red/Green but with Gen III Quality Of Life Changes plus has most post game. Let's Go Pikachu & Eevee is Yellow but on the Switch with modern stuff e.g No HMs +18 types + Megas & used Pokémon Go Mechanics.
    

2)Crystal was "the most complete" of the Gen II games so would give a faithful taste of Gen II. Heart Gold/Soul Silver are remakes done in the style of Gen IV + physical/Special split & the most content e.g Crystal has Battle Tower & Bug Catching+ Kanto for Post Game, Heart Gold/Soul Silver has the Gen IV Battle Frontier; Safari Zone Bug Catching; Pokeathlon + improved Kanto, as post game activities.

3)Emerald was the most complete of Gen III Hoenn Games, with both Team Magma & Team Aqua as antagonists+ the 1st Battle Frontier (the version one that inspired the anime arc). Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire being Gen VI remakes had Mega Evolutions + physical/special split + but didn't have Battle Frontier & the story diverges slightly from the original Ruby/Sapphire, especially in the late to post game.

4a) Platinum was the most complete version of the Gen IV games having better engine & more intense story + Gen IV Battle Frontier. Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl are faithful remakes on Switch, that were more inline with traditional remakes (being Diamond/Pearl in 3D, on a Unity engine, with Fairy types, some alt clothes & no HMs.

4b) at the same time they announced BD/SP they announced Legends Arceus, which released 2 months later. Being a Prequel (if we say Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl were set 2006 (based on when Diamond/Pearl released in Japan), then Legends Arceus is set around 1890 (Officially it set in the Pokémon equivalent of Menji era (1868-1912) so middle of era would be 1890)) it's gimmick is the idea of player slowly introducing ideas of Pokemon being companions rather than scary creatures. Gameplay wise its very different to standard Pokémon games.

5)With the Unova games, they tried something different and instead of having a most complete version (e.g a Grey version), they did sequels so full effect would be Black then Black 2 or White then White 2

6) only X or Y exist so far, though a Legends Game set in Kalos has been announced to release in 2025. In the meantime, guess which one has the version exclusives you prefer

7) Sun or Moon have arguably the better story (Lusamine as the villain Vs Necrozma and/or Team Rainbow Rocket) but Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon is the most complete content wise (this is the same as say Blue/Yellow/Crystal/Emerald/Platinum, just split into two) with 5 Pokemon, 5 forms, 6 Z-moves that aren't coded into Sun/Moon. Between Sun or Moon, only differences is version exclusives + in the case of US/UM certain Ultra Beast planets/Dimensions.

8)Sword or Shield version, but with the versions DLC e.g you'll want Sword Expansion Pass for Sword Version. Is most complete way to do Galar/Gen VIII in full. The differences are Version exclusives as normal but also different Gym Leaders

9) similar situation with Sword/Shield, with only Scarlet/Violet and each versions respective DLCs representing Paldea, Kitikami (DLC 1) & Unova/Blueberry Academy (DLC 2), but only difference here is version exclusives & Outfits (Scarlet have Orange accent colours on clothes & Violet has Purple instead.
